# Technical Specifications of the Challenge

This challenge requires us to read a data stream from a `.csv` file and then print that information out line by line to the console.

The `main.cpp` file needs to have four functions including the `main()` function:

1. `main()` to execute
2. `readFile()` to read the parsed lines from the `parseFile()` function below
3. `parseLines()` to parse the data read from the `.csv` file 
4. `printFile()` to print the parsed data from the file
